# Unlock Rapid Development: Your Angular 20 Boilerplate for VibeCoding & Beyond!

**Welcome to Angularvibecoding!** This isn't just another template; it's a launchpad for building beautiful, modern, and high-performance web applications. It's pre-configured with a cutting-edge tech stack and structured for maximum productivity, scalability, and developer satisfaction.

This boilerplate is **Tailwind 4 and DaisyUI ready** and optimized for cloud-based IDEs like **Firebase Studio**.

---

## ✨ Template Cleaned

This template has been cleaned and is ready for your project! The authentication examples and demo pages have been removed, leaving you with a clean slate while keeping all the configuration, styling, and core structure intact.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Future-Proof Angular:** Built on the latest **Angular 20** with a fully `standalone` architecture. No `NgModules`, just pure, modern components.
- **Reactive at its Core:** Leverages **Angular Signals** for clean, intuitive state management and the new **`@if` / `@for` / `@defer`** control flow for lightning-fast UIs.
- **Stunning UIs Out-of-the-Box:** Comes with **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI** fully integrated via SCSS. Create beautiful designs without ever leaving your component files.
- **Built for AI Collaboration:** This repository is meticulously documented and structured to provide perfect context for **Google's Gemini Code Assist**, turning it into your expert pair programmer.

## 🤖 Mastering Context: Optimizing Gemini Code Assist

This project is designed to transform Gemini from a general AI into a specialized expert on _this_ boilerplate. By understanding the following principles, you will get more accurate and consistent code.

### 1. The Project Manifest (`README.md`)

You're reading it! This file is the "master prompt" that tells Gemini about our architecture, tech stack, and conventions.

#### ✨ Our Vibe: Coding Conventions & Principles

- **Architecture:** We use a `standalone` feature-based structure. Components, directives, and services are self-contained.
- **Component Naming:** We keep it clean. No `.component.ts` or `.service.ts` suffixes.
- **Styling:** SCSS is the primary engine. Tailwind and DaisyUI classes are used directly in HTML templates for rapid UI development.
- **Philosophy:** Write clean, scalable, and reactive code. **Signals** are preferred for state management. **RxJS** is reserved for complex asynchronous operations.

### 2. Scoped Context with `.vscode/settings.json`

To focus Gemini, we explicitly define which files matter most. Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your project root with the following to reduce noise and improve suggestion quality:

```json
{
  "gemini.context.include": ["src/app/**/*.ts", "src/app/**/*.html", "src/app/**/*.scss", "angular.json", "package.json", "README.md"]
}
```

### 3. In-Code Directives (Comments)

Guide Gemini at the file level with `@context:` comments. This is incredibly powerful for ensuring consistency.

- **TypeScript Example (`.ts`):**

  ```typescript
  // @context: Standalone Angular 20 login component using signals for reactive form state.
  import { Component, signal } from "@angular/core";
  ```

- **HTML Example (`.html`):**

  ```html
  <!-- @context: Component template styled with a mix of SCSS, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. -->
  <div class="hero">...</div>
  ```

---

## Tech Stack

Angular 20 standalone (no NgModules)

Angular Signals (signal, computed, effect, linkedSignal)

Resource API for async operations and AI/LLM integration

Modern Control Flow: @if, @for, @defer

TailwindCSS + DaisyUI (with SCSS, no tailwind.config.js)

RxJS for complex asynchronous operations

SCSS as the main styling engine

**AI-Ready:** Built-in patterns for AI/LLM integration (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, etc.)

## 🧹 Clean Template Script - Two Modes!

Want to start fresh? This template includes demo authentication pages and example components to help you understand the structure. Once you're ready to build your own project, choose from **two cleaning modes**:

### Mode 1: 🎨 Dashboard Mode (Recommended)

Perfect for dashboards, admin panels, and full-featured apps.

**Keeps:**

- ✅ Complete layout structure (header, sidebar, footer)
- ✅ Collapsible navigation
- ✅ Professional dashboard structure

```bash
npm run clean-template:dashboard
```

### Mode 2: ✨ Blank Mode

Perfect for custom designs, landing pages, starting from absolute scratch.

**Removes:**

- ❌ ALL layout components (header, sidebar, footer)
- ✅ Gives you a minimal single page to build from

```bash
npm run clean-template:blank
```

### Interactive Selection

Not sure which mode? Run the interactive selector:

```bash
npm run clean-template
```

It will ask you to choose:

- **1** = Dashboard Mode (keeps layout structure)
- **2** = Blank Mode (minimal scaffold)

**Both modes:**

- ✅ Remove all demo/example pages (login, register, auth, etc.)
- ✅ Keep all configuration and styling (TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, .cursorrules)
- ✅ Give you a beautiful welcome page
- ✅ Keep shared utilities (notification, spinner)
- ✅ **Optional:** Remove cleaning scripts themselves for completely fresh start

📖 See detailed comparison: [docs/clean-template-modes.md](docs/clean-template-modes.md)

**Bonus Feature:** After cleaning, you'll be asked if you want to remove the cleaning scripts themselves (the `scripts/` folder and npm commands). This gives you a completely fresh start with no template artifacts!

### Why the Clean Slate Matters

Running one of the cleaning modes preserves all of the context-building assets (this `README.md`, `.cursorrules`, docs, and AI pattern guides) while stripping away demo code. That means every new project you spin up starts with:

- A focused file tree that matches the conventions documented here, so Gemini and other AI assistants immediately understand the architecture.
- Ready-to-use best-practice patterns for signals, AI resources, and styling—no need to reverse-engineer sample components first.
- A consistent onboarding story for teammates and future you: the README stays your master prompt and the rest of the docs stay relevant because the template has already been aligned to them.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component path/your-component-name
```

**Important Naming and Structure Conventions:**

- **No Suffixes for Core Files:** This project does **not** use standard Angular file suffixes like `.component.ts` or `.service.ts`. For example, a login component's TypeScript file would be `login.ts` (not `login.component.ts`).
- **Descriptive Naming:** Always use clear and descriptive names for your components, services, etc.
- **Group by Feature/Type:** Organize related files within dedicated folders. Follow a structure similar to this:
- `/auth/` for login, registration, guards, authentication services.
- `/core/` for header, footer, layout, sidenav, global singleton services.
- `/features/` for distinct business feature modules (e.g., `/products`, `/orders`).
- `/shared/` for reusable components, pipes, directives, and utility services.

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## 🤖 AI/LLM Integration

This template includes comprehensive patterns for integrating AI and LLM APIs:

- ✅ Signal-based request triggering
- ✅ LinkedSignal for chat history and streaming responses
- ✅ Resource API for async AI operations
- ✅ Streaming support for real-time AI responses
- ✅ Proper loading/error states for AI features
- ✅ Type-safe AI response handling

📖 **Full Guide:** [docs/ai-integration-patterns.md](docs/ai-integration-patterns.md)

**Supported AI Providers:**

- Google Gemini API
- Firebase Genkit
- OpenAI API
- Anthropic Claude
- Any REST or streaming API

**Example: Simple AI Component**

```typescript
@Component({...})
export class AIChat {
  userInput = signal('');
  submittedPrompt = signal('');

  aiResponse = resource({
    params: () => this.submittedPrompt(),
    loader: async ({params}) => {
      return await this.aiService.generate(params);
    }
  });

  onSubmit() {
    this.submittedPrompt.set(this.userInput());
  }
}
```

✨ Coding Conventions & Key Principles
This is crucial for ensuring generated code is consistent with your project's style.

Architecture: The project uses a feature-based structure. All components, services, and directives are standalone.

Styling: SCSS is integrated directly. TailwindCSS classes are used in templates without a tailwind.config.js file. DaisyUI provides UI components.

Philosophy: The primary goal is to write clean, scalable, and reactive UI-oriented code. Signals and the new control flow (@if, @for) are preferred over RxJS for simple state management and NgIf/NgFor.
